jwt.expiration=3600000
#A JSON Web Token (JWT) expiration date is the time after which the token is no longer valid and cannot be processed. The expiration date is configured and is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The token expires on the expiration date plus one minute before the time it was generated. For example, if a token is generated at 2:30 PM on January 10 and the expiration date is set for January 11, the token expires at 2:29 PM on January 11.
